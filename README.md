# dealership_emails
This project*: 
1. Scrapes emails from the "meet our staff" page on car dealerships' websites
2. Open's a new csv file called "emails_scraped.csv"
3. Appends the scraped emails in such csv file

You'll need these donwloaded:
* BeautifulSoup
* requests
* csv

## emails_scraped.py
This file is the python code. It is a short and simplified version of the project's purpose.

## emails_scraped.ipynb
This jupyter notebook file is the extended version of the python code. It includes comments with details and explanations of what the file is doing, as well as different examples of how you can scrape different websites (all of them are different). The 4th example explains how to skip "NoneType", or null values, for situations in which the website is missing an email.

* *The links for the websites that I used originally are not included.*
